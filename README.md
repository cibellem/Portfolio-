# Portfolio-
Professional Portfolio webpage created with HTML elements and styled with CSS stylesheet.
I built this project to share with others my learning steps during my journey as a Web Development Student.
The most challeging part for me was floating images and elements in the page. This assigment helped me to understand better how they work and I feel more confident manupulating them.
Key Words:
Floating, Navigation Bar, Sticky Footer, Forms, Box over images.
